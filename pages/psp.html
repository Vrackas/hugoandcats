                <p> Payment systems, which operate on the basis of plastic cards and electronic Internet tools,
                    have been successfully operating in the market for a long time. This is a common activity
                    that can bring a lot of benefits, especially in online Commerce (including online gambling).
                </p>
                <p>In order to legally implement it, banks (Issuer and acquirer) need a license issued at the
                    state level by the country to which they belong. Without it, it is impossible to work the
                    processing center, which, in fact, processes payments, linking financial and commercial
                    organizations with end users of services/products.
                    In order for the payment system to be able to "work" with cards of all banks and currencies
                    of most countries, coordinate transactions qualitatively and at the same time ensure
                    profitability of its owners, the choice of jurisdiction should be approached carefully. Very
                    often for this purpose, offshore companies are used. There, with the help of flexible tax
                    mechanisms and a high level of confidentiality, you can get a good "return" from the
                    activities. One of the most pragmatic, proven and accessible States is Belize, a country in
                    the Caribbean. It is a member of the British Commonwealth and, thanks to the minimum capital
                    requirements and the time required to obtain a licence, can be considered the best
                    choice.</p>
                <strong>THE ADVANTAGES AND PROCEDURE OF LICENSING IN BELIZE</strong>


                <p>Since e-Commerce has become a priority for the state (this includes the license of the
                    payment
                    system), Belize invests much effort in the improvement of Internet communications.
                    High-speed
                    networks coupled with traditional offshore capabilities make it an excellent choice.
                </p>
                <p>*IFSC - Commission on international financial services performs licensing regulation in the
                    country. This regulator has developed a clear regulation:</p>
                <p>*the application form for the license is filled in and sent along with the package of
                    supporting
                    documentation (data on the type of activity, reserve capital, applicants);</p>
                <p>*the fee is $ 500, which is not refundable even in case of refusal to grant a license;</p>
                <p>*with a favorable outcome is paid an annual license fee - from 2500 to 5000 dollars;</p>
                <p>*monthly to the Commission a report of the work not later than the 10th day;</p>
                <p> *once a year the license must be confirmed - IFSC ascertain the effectiveness of the
                    applicant
                    and makes a decision about his prospects.</p>
                <p>For those who need a license payment system, Belize puts the following requirements:
                    the minimum size of the reserve capital (depending on the selected activity - from five to
                    one
                    hundred thousand dollars);
                    maintenance of capital in a licensed Bank / financial institution in the territory of the
                    state.

            <div class="panel">
                    <p> Most users of payment systems, as well as banks, are sensitive to their counterparties and
                        their
                        reliability. Any error or inaccuracy can lead to failures in the work of the company or to
                        an
                        increase in its operating costs. Therefore, it is important to take into account all the
                        details, including its jurisdiction. Opportunities for work traditionally provides a Cyprus
                        ‒
                        based payment systems can easily interact with the created in the company or the relevant
                        offshore Bank account.</p>
                    <strong>THE ADVANTAGES OF REGISTRATION OF PAYMENT SYSTEMS IN CYPRUS</strong>
                    <p>1. Organizations registered as financial entities on the island are permitted to conduct such
                        transactions, currency conversion, storage/processing of information and other related
                        services.
                    </p>
                    <p>2. The legislation of Cyprus is well structured, modern and covers all the issues in this
                        area.

                        stock exchanges, and it strictly monitors compliance with formalities. To obtain a license,
                        a
                        payment organization must be registered in the jurisdiction, its Directorate must have a
                        positive reputation and a high level of professional knowledge (nominee management is not

                    <strong>FEATURES OF THE CYPRIOT PAYMENT SYSTEMS</strong>

                    <p>According to the legislation of the UK e-money represents a monetary value, represented by
                        the liabilities of the Issuer, which is stored in electronic form and is accepted for
                        payments by third parties. Electronic money is considered to be the electronic equivalent of
                        coins and banknotes intended for making payments for small amounts.</p>

                    <p>In the UK, the payment system, whose functions include the issuance of electronic money, as
                        well as in Europe, can only be created in the form of EMI (Electronic Money Institution).
                        Depending on the turnover, there are 2 types of electronic money companies in the UK:
                        EMI, a classic electronic money institution, in which case the fee (duty) in FCA will be
                        £5,000;
                        Small EM (if the monthly turnover does not exceed €3 000 000, if the company did not
                        operate, then we estimate the forecasts), in this case, the contribution to the FCA will be
                        £1 000. It is also worth noting that a small electronic money institution (EMI) has the
                        right to provide its services only within the UK. If the limit of €3 000 000 is reached, the
                        applicant is obliged to give in to receive a full EMI license from a small one
                    </p>
                    <strong>REGULATION OF ELECTRONIC MONEY ISSUER</strong>

                    <p>As with the European financial market, EMI's operations in the UK are governed by the EU
                        Directive 2009/110/EC on Electronic money (hereinafter referred to as the EU Directive).
                        In addition, at the state level, the Inspectorate for supervision of financial institutions
                        of
                        the United Kingdom (FCA) issued a Regulation on electronic money (hereinafter - the
                        Regulation).
                        This Provision was approved on the basis of an EU Directive, but it contains more details
                        regarding the establishment of an EMI within the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, the Central regulator issuing licenses to institutions of electronic money in the
                        UK
                        is the Inspectorate for control over the activities of financial organizations in great
                        Britain
                        (hereinafter - FCA). FCA regulates the use of electronic money in accordance with the EU
                        Directive on electronic money. Issuers of electronic money also have obligations in
                        accordance
                        with the Provisions on money laundering. If suspicious activity is detected, the company is
                        legally obliged to report it to the authorities.</p>
                    <p> The financial supervision service requires issuers of electronic money to prove that they
                        are
                        able to properly control the risks they face in their work. Measures that may be taken by
                        electronic money issuers to fulfil their legal obligations are discussed in the Guidelines
                        of
                        the Joint steering group on money laundering control.</p>
                    <p> Simultaneously with the application for a license, the Regulator will need to submit a
                        detailed
                        business plan; a detailed description of the procedures for identifying customers,
                        preventing
                        money laundering, obtained illegally; a detailed description of the operations that are
                        planned
                        to be provided to customers; full information about the founders/shareholders, as well as
                        about
                        the top management of the company.</p>
                    <p>The total term of consideration of the application for a license is up to 3 months. However,
                        if
                        the FCA deems it necessary to request additional information on the applicant, the period of
                        consideration of the application may be extended to 12 months.
                        REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ELECTRONIC MONEY IN THE UK.</p>
                    <p>To apply for a license for electronic money (EMI) in the UK can only tax resident companies.
                        This means the applicant company can only be registered in England.
                        In turn, the founders / shareholders of such companies can be both residents and
                        non-residents
                        of the United Kingdom, individuals or legal entities.</p>
                    <p> UK law, unlike many other jurisdictions, contains quite strict requirements for the top
                        management of the company electronic money (EMI), among which we can highlight the need to
                        have
                        sufficient education and knowledge for the management of the Issuer of electronic money.
                        This implies the following:</p>
                    <p>- top management should have experience in launching such companies. For FCA, this
                        correspondence is important, people who do not have any experience in this field, usually do
                        not
                        get permission.</p>
                    <p>- management of e-money company should be from the UK. The FCA identifies the following key
                        points:</p>
                    <p>1. The company must have more UK resident Directors (or an equal number) than foreign
                        Directors
                        (their nationality does not matter).</p>
                    <p> 2. The FCA implies that the resident Director's decisions have a dominant power, he can say
                        "no"
                        to the policies, strategies and decisions that usually come from abroad, in case of their
                        conflict with UK law or regulations.</p>
                    <p> 3. Meetings of the Board of Directors should be held in the UK.</p>
                    <p>4. Operational day-to-day decisions should be made in the UK and the office itself should be
                        based in the same state.</p>
                    <p>5. The company may have a non-resident Director on the Board of Directors of a British
                        company
                        if the rest of the company is based in the UK.</p>
                    <p>6. The CEO must be a resident and reside in the UK, and usually in practice, a compliance
                        Manager too.</p>
                    <p>7. The anti-money laundering officer, who may also be the Director General, if qualified)
                        must
                        be a resident of the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>8. If someone moves to the UK to be CEO, he should read the rules of management, depending on
                        the business model, therefore you may need to recruit the local Manager which has the
                        authority
                        to monitor compliance.</p>
                    <strong>THE OFFICE OF THE E-MONEY ISSUER IN THE UK</strong>
                    <p> For the applicant to receive a license of electronic money (ELMI) provides a mandatory
                        requirement to have a physical office in the UK.</p>

                    <p>The amount of authorized capital for the establishment of electronic money (EMI) is provided
                        by
                        the EU Directive and is 350 000 EUR. The size of the authorized capital shall be maintained
                        during the whole period of activity of the enterprises.
                    </p>
                    <strong>THE TERRITORY OF VALIDITY OF THE LICENCE OF ELECTRONIC MONEY</strong>
                    <p>The company is licensed to issue e-money, has the right to provide their services
                        exclusively in
                        the territory of the United Kingdom. However, as in the case of an e-money company from
                        Europe,
                        it can pass certification in any EU country under a simplified procedure, which greatly
                        facilitates the procedure of gaining new markets.</p>
                    <p>Rules for mandatory accounting and tax reporting are provided for the establishment of
                        electronic money. As well as the need to undergo an annual audit.</p>
                    <p>Thus, summing up the above conditions, we can confidently say that the UK is the most
                        strictly
                        regulated jurisdiction in respect of the activities of issuers of electronic money.</p>

                    <p>*The company's registered capital of 350 000 EUR</p>

                    <p>Bank account opening</p>
                    <p>A company licensed with e-money in the UK will be able to open a Bank account in any
                        jurisdiction. It is also possible to freely cooperate with any financial institutions.</p>
                    <strong>REPUTATION</strong>
                    <p>In 2016, the UK took 13th place in the ranking, assessing the reputation of the world, with
                        an
                        index of 71.08. This rating is based on a number of factors, including export quality.
                        Contribution to world culture. Standard of living, General tolerance, security, etc.
                        However, the field on June 27, when the country held a referendum on Britain's withdrawal
                        from
                        the EU, the country's credit rating fell sharply, which means that cash flows to the country
                        may
                        further decline. In addition, on the same day, the London stock exchange recorded the fact
                        of
                        stopping trading in shares of the two largest banks (Barclyas and RBS), continued to fall
                        the
                        pound sterling against other currencies.
                        In summary we can say that after the referendum the UK has become less predictable, stable
                        and
                        effective in shaping its policy. Despite this, the UK, after all, has its significant
                        advantages
                        and can rightly be considered one of the best countries to create a business.</p>
